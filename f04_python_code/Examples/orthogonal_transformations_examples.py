# Orthogonal transformations
# Theory: https://mathworld.wolfram.com/EulerAngles.html
# According to Euler's rotation theorem, any rotation may be described using three angles.
# If the rotations are written in terms of rotation matrices D, C, and B, then a general
# rotation A can be written as: A = B + C + D
#
# Euler Angels:
# The three angles giving the three rotation matrices are called Euler angles.
# There are several conventions for Euler angles, depending on the axes about which
# the rotations are carried out. Write the matrix A as:
# A=[[a_(11) a_(12) a_(13)],
#    [a_(21) a_(22) a_(23)],
#    [a_(31) a_(32) a_(33)]].
#
# The so-called "x-convention," illustrated above, is the most common definition.
# In this convention, the rotation given by Euler angles (phi,theta,psi), where:
# 1. the first rotation is by an angle phi about the z-axis using D,
# 2. the second rotation is by an angle theta in [0,pi] about the former x-axis (now x^') using C, and
# 3. the third rotation is by an angle psi about the former z-axis (now z^') using B.
#
# But there are many conventions for the angles are in common use.
#
# 1. Convention from my lectures:
# alpha - precession angle
# D = [[cos(alpha), -sin(alpha), 0],
#      [sin(alpha),  cos(alpha), 0],
#      [    0     ,      0     , 1]]
# beta - nutation angle
# C = [[1,  0     ,      0      ],
#      [0, cos(beta), -sin(beta)],
#      [0, sin(beta),  cos(beta)]]
# gamma - self-rotation angle
# B = [[cos(gamma), -sin(gamma), 0],
#      [sin(gamma),  cos(gamma), 0],
#      [    0     ,      0     , 1]]
#
# 2. In the "xyz (pitch-roll-yaw) convention," theta is pitch, psi is roll, and phi is yaw.
#
# D	=	[[ cos(phi), sin(phi), 0],
#        [-sin(phi), cos(phi), 0],
#        [    0    ,    0    , 1]]
#
# C	=	[[cos(theta), 0, -sin(theta)],
#        [     0    , 1,      0     ],
#        [sin(theta), 0,  cos(theta)]]
#
# B	=	[[1,          0,     0   ],
#         [0,  cos(psi), sin(psi)],
#         [0, -sin(psi), cos(psi)]]
#
